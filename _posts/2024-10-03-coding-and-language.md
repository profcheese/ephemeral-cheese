title: "coding-and-language"

i enter git hub as a scholar of communication, meaning that i am interested in how we use language as a network of shared meaning. external checks and verification. intersubjectivity. the phenomenological experience of learning.
sitting in KAIC 100, I find myself being asked to "produce content" but I don't know what kind of content i want to make, nor do i really know what to do.

I do think that language is a game. and coding is a language. therefore coding is a game. but, coding is also a game we can use to make other games. something, something, something--finite and infinte games. 

and i find myself wondering: how much space does 1 occupy? how much does 2 weigh? what happens when the ones and the twos spin off into infinity, tracked as switches on a microprocesser, and then sent into the cloud.
